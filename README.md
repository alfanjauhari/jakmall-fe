## A little story
`styled-components` make it easy for me to build this application, I can easily apply theme variables that can be used on any page and reduce code duplication (read about DRY [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)).

React hook form is also a hero in the development of this application, because with it this application can have form features that can run responsively and reactively so that it can create a user experience that is right for the user.
